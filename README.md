- Percentage calculations
- Negation of numbers
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- Backspace button to remove the last input
- Decimal point support
- Keyboard input support
- Error handling for invalid calculations and division by zero
- Display of both the current expression and the result
- Results are rounded to 10 decimal places and displayed up to 10 digits

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the on-screen buttons to input numbers and perform calculations:
   - Click on number buttons (0-9) to input digits
   - Click on operator buttons (+, -, *, /, %) to select an operation

## Error Handling

- The calculator displays "Error" when attempting to perform invalid calculations, such as division by zero.
- Invalid operations are ignored to prevent errors.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator
- `styles.css`: Defines the visual styling of the calculator
- `script.js`: Implements the calculator's functionality

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced operations (square root, exponents, etc.)
- Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Add a history of calculations
- Improve error handling and display more specific error messages
